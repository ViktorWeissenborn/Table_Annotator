      <text>The aqueous ozonolysis of α-pinene and β-pinene was conducted under simulated tropospheric conditions at different pHs and temperatures. Three kinds of products, peroxides, carbonyl compounds, and organic acids, were well characterized, and the detection of these products provides effective evidence for understanding the atmospheric aqueous reaction pathway. We have two interesting findings: (1) the unexpected formation of methacrolein (MACR), with a yield of ∼40%, in the α-pinene–O3 aqueous reaction indicates a potentially new SOA formation pathway, because MACR is one of the important precursors of SOA; and (2) the surprisingly high yields of H2O2, ∼60% for the α-pinene–O3 reaction and ∼100% for the β-pinene–O3 reaction, indicates that H2O2 can be a significant contributor to the origin and transformation of oxidants in the atmosphere, especially in the humid regions. Moreover, we have determined the rate constant for aqueous reaction between MACR and H2O2 in pH 2 to 7 and obtained its upper limit as 0.13 M L−1 s−1. A mechanism concerning the formation of the species mentioned above is proposed, and it differs from that in the gas-phase reaction. We suggest that water plays a key role in the mechanism, by participating in the reactions as a direct reactant and by removing the excess energy of intermediates formed in the reactions.</text>

      <text>Recently, a large number of studies have been devoted to the secondary organic aerosols (SOA), calculating their yields, size distribution, and number, elucidating their reaction mechanisms including homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions, and modeling their formation ( ). SOA levels measured in field campaigns tend to exceed those predicted by global chemical transport models ( ). This inconsistency is due to the incomplete understanding of the mechanisms explaining SOA formation. Therefore, further research is needed to eliminate the uncertainties in SOA formation mechanisms. Knowledge with regard to the aqueous chemistry is helpful to reduce these uncertainties. Laboratory and model study have revealed that the contribution of aqueous reactions to the SOA formation is significant ( ). Therefore, to reduce the uncertainties in the SOA formation mechanism, there is a need for investigations into the performance of water in the atmosphere. The chemistry of monoterpenes has received much attention, since large quantities of them are emitted globally ( ) and they have usually high chemical activity ( ). Studies have shown that the reactions of monoterpenes with OH/O3/NO3 produce high-weight species, which are recognized to be the precursors of SOA as they have lower vapor pressure compared to the volatile organic compounds, such as pinonaldehyde, pinic, and pinonic acid for α-pinene; and nopinone, pinic acid, and pinalic-3 acid for β-pinene ( ; ). Moreover, the ozonolysis of monoterpenes is thought to be a major source of SOA ( ). New models for the oxidation of α-pinene which results in the formation of SOA show that ozonolysis has double the contribution to SOA formation compared with oxidation by OH ( ). In the present study, the aqueous ozonolysis of α/β-pinene was investigated under simulated tropospheric conditions, at different pH values and temperatures. The major products, including small-molecular carbonyls, peroxides, and organic acids, were identified and their yields were well characterized. These products provide useful information for understanding the mechanisms underlying the aqueous ozonolysis of α/β-pinene. These proposed mechanisms form the basis for a discussion on the contribution of these two reactions studied to the productions of H2O2 and MACR. 2</text>

      <text>Ultrapure water (MilliQ system, Millipore) was used for the preparation of the reagent aqueous solutions. The stock solutions were prepared using α-pinene (Fluka, 99+% purity) and β-pinene (TCI, 95+% purity) diluted in acetonitrile (TEDIA, 99.9+% purity), with the concentration of 1 mM, respectively. The initial concentrations of ozone were 4–12 μM. The 15 ml stock solution was mixed with the 490 ml ozone-containing water, resulting in 20 μM α/β-pinene and 4–12 μM ozone in the reaction mixture, as described below. Standardizing chemicals, including formaldehyde (36.5% in water solution, Riedel-delaen), methacrolein (MACR) (≥95%, Sigma), and H2O2 (35% in water solution, Sigma), were used for the identification and quantification of products. As blank experiments, a mixture of water saturated with oxygen and α/β-pinene was prepared and analyzed by the methods described in Section . No peroxides, carbonyl compounds, or organic acids were detected for the blank experiments. 2.2</text>

      <text>The experimental apparatus comprised an ozone generator, an ozone solution generator, and an aqueous reactor, as described in our previous work ( ). The aqueous experiments were performed by mixing 490 ml of ozone solution with 10 ml of α/β-pinene stock solution in the aqueous reactor. The reaction solution was shaken thoroughly and was then placed in a thermostat in darkness. There was a 15 ml gas space above the liquid, which allowed the reaction solution to be mixed. Because of this gas space, the upper limit for the losses of aqueous ozone and β-pinene were estimated to be 7.1% and 2.5% at 298K, based on their Henry constants. This mostly eliminated the contribution of the gas-phase reaction, so that the reaction could be regarded as an aqueous reaction. A small amount of H2O2 was found in the ozone solution before the organic reactant was added. Several possible mechanisms exist for aqueous H2O2 formation from O3; these mechanisms involve species such as HO, HO2 and O2− acting as intermediates ( ; ). The H2O2 formed in the ozone solution was measured in each experiment and was considered in the data analysis. 2.3</text>

Peroxides were analyzed online using the post-column derivatization method with HPLC, in which hydroxyphenylacetic acid was oxidized to a fluorescent dimmer by peroxides and was catalyzed by hemin ( ). Organic acids were analyzed using ion chromatography with an ED50 conductivity detector (DIONEX 2650, USA). The concentration of ozone in the aqueous phase was determined using indigo disulphonate spectrophotometry. 3</text>

      <text>Before elucidating the detailed reaction mechanism, the stoichiometric proportion of α/β-pinene reaction with ozone must be known. We conducted two sets of experiments, exceeding the quantity of each reactant respectively, to determine this proportion. Specifically, the first set was carried out with excess α/β-pinene and with ozone completely consumed. The yields for two major products formed from ozonolysis of α-pinene can be obtained as 40% for MACR and 60% for H2O2, as shown in . In the second set, the reaction was carried out with excess ozone, ranging from 6 to 8 μM, and with a known-concentration of α/β-pinene (3, 4, and 5 μM) as the limiting reactant. We found that the yield of MACR calculated in alpha-pinene–O3 reaction was slightly lower than 40%, indicating that a small amount of MACR (A(MACR)) might be consumed by ozone under the condition of excess ozone. We use A(MACR) to obtain the amount of ozone (A(O3−MACR)) consumed by MACR. Accordingly, when we determine the amount of ozone consumed by α-pinene (A(O3−alpha)), we should certainly subtract A(O3−MACR) from the combined ozone consumption (A(O3−com)), which was determined by indigo disulphonate spectrophotometry before and after the ozonation, namely, A(O3−alpha)=A(O3−com)−A(O3−MACR). The reaction molar ratios were determined to be 1:0.98 ± 0.06 for α-pinene: O3, and 1:1.02 ± 0.06 for β-pinene: O3. Accordingly, we suggest that both α-pinene–O3 and β-pinene–O3 reactions in the aqueous phase proceed with a stoichiometric proportion of 1:1, as shown in . 3.2</text>

      <text>A series of experiments for the aqueous ozonolysis of α-pinene and β-pinene were carried out at different pH values (pH = 3.0, 5.4, 7.0) and temperatures (277, 283, 298 K). The results from these experiments were: (1) for peroxides products, H2O2 was identified in both α-pinene–O3 and β-pinene–O3 systems; (2) for carbonyl products, MACR was identified in the α-pinene–O3 system, as discussed in Section , whereas formaldehyde (HCHO) was identified in the β-pinene–O3 system; (3) for organic acid products, no small-molecular (≤C3) species were detected in either of the two systems; and (4) all the products detected in these two reaction systems were independent of both pH and temperature. A pattern of kinetic curves for the ozonolysis of α-pinene at pH values of 7.0 and 298 K was shown in a . The ozonation was finished well under 5 min. The concentrations of both H2O2 and MACR increased rapidly within 5 min and reached a plateau during the following 24 h (not shown in a). The results were similar for the β-pinene–O3 system, shown in b. shows how the yields of products formed in the ozonolysis reactions vary under different conditions. In the present study, the yield is defined as the ratio of the production molar amount of a product versus the consumption molar amount of a reactant. The yields are independent of the pH levels and the temperatures. Their values are as follows: (1) For the α-pinene–O3 system, ∼60% for H2O2 and ∼40% for MACR; and (2) for the β-pinene–O3 system, ∼100% for H2O2 and ∼60% for HCHO. 3.3</text>

      <text>As shown in , H2O2 was detected in the aqueous ozonolysis of α-pinene and β-pinene, with yields of ∼60% and ∼100%, respectively. Such high H2O2 yields were unexpected. found much lower peroxide yields in the aqueous ozonolysis of α-pinene and β-pinene, at 11.3% and 16.2%, respectively. Our yields are much higher than theirs, primarily due to different experimental apparatus, namely, the static reactor and the bubbling system, in which a certain amount of α/β-pinene might escape into ambient air during reaction. Another probable explanation for the different yields is that carried out their reactions at concentrations ∼20–40 times higher than those used in the present study. Therefore, we suggest that the peroxide yields in aqueous ozonolysis of α/β-pinene have been significantly underestimated before. 3.3.2</text>

      <text>No HMHP was detected for the β-pinene–O3 system; however, this is inconsistent with existing knowledge regarding the ozonolysis of terminal alkenes. It has been postulated that molozonide formed by the addition of ozone is not stable, and that the two peroxy O–O bonds and the C–C bond cleave simultaneously. In particular, for β-pinene, the cleavage of molozonide has been estimated to form two corresponding Creigee intermediates ( ). One of them, [CH2OO]*, will form HMHP in the following steps, as presented in reactions . (1) (2) However, there seems to be only one decomposition pathway for molozonide in the aqueous ozonolysis of β-pinene. This decomposition pathway can not produce [CH2OO]*, which is the precursor of HMHP as shown in reaction . This hypothesis is consistent with the concept that the decomposition producing the more highly substituted intermediate would be preferred ( ). We suggest that β-pinene has an exocyclic double bond, and that the steric obstruction of the nine-carbon circle at one end of the C C double bond may impact the cleavage of molozonide. 3.4</text>

      <text>In the α-pinene–O3 system, the product MACR was unexpectedly observed having a relative high yield of ∼40%. To validate this finding, three MACR standard solutions were prepared. These three standard solutions were each mixed with the experimental samples with a volume ratio of 1:1, resulting in three mixtures. The chromatograms for the experimental sample and the three mixtures are shown in . The chromatogram of the experimental sample presents a main peak (∼16.4 min) and a small peak (∼16.0 min). It can be seen that there is no shoulder peak of the main peak (∼16.4 min) in each chromatogram of these three mixtures, indicating that the unknown carbonyl (UC) in the experimental sample may be MACR. In addition, if UC was considered as MACR, its concentration is estimated to be 3.74 μM. When it was mixed with the standard MACR solutions mentioned above with the volume ratio 1: 1, the concentrations of these three mixtures should be 3.02 μM, 4.17 μM, and 6.47 μM, respectively, resulting in a concentration ratio (RC) 1: 1.38: 2.14. The ratio of the integrated area of peak (RA) at ∼16.4 min for the three mixtures is 1: 1.36: 1.92. RA agrees well with RC, indicating the consideration of UC as MACR is reasonable. Moreover, we have ruled out two isomerides of MACR, namely, methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) and crotonaldehyde, because these three species can be separated effectively by our HPLC method, as shown in . Summarizing the evidence mentioned above, we conclude that the main peak at ∼16.4 min is attributed to MACR. To determine the yield of MACR, its reaction with ozone should be considered first. An important property of MACR is that its reaction with ozone proceeds by the addition of ozone to the C C double bond, producing methylglyoxyl (MG), HMHP, and HCHO with yields 99%, 70%, and 32%, respectively, as shown in reaction ( ): (3) Accordingly, the actual yield of MACR should include its fraction reacted with ozone. To achieve this goal, we need to compare the reaction rate constants between α-pinene–O3 and MACR–O3 in the aqueous phase. To the best of our knowledge, the data regarding the rate constant of aqueous ozonolysis of α-pinene is limited. So we made an analogy between isoprene and α-pinene. In the gas phase, k(alpha-pinene−O3)g, 8.4 × 10−17 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 at 298 K, is six times higher than k(isoprene−O3)g, 1.27 × 10−17 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 at 298 K, and both these two values are one order of magnitude higher than k(MACR−O3)g, 1.2 × 10−18 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 at 298 K ( ); while in the aqueous phase k(isoprene−O3)a, 4.1 × 105 M−1 s−1 at 298 K, is ten times higher than k(MACR−O3)a, 2.4 × 104 M−1 s−1 at 298 K ( ). Accordingly, it can be expected that k(alpha-pinene−O3)a might be much higher than k(MACR−O3)a in the aqueous phase, indicating that the α-pinene–O3 reaction dominates and MACR–O3 reaction can be neglected when the levels of these three species are comparable in the solution. Another method is to identify the products, namely, HCHO, MG, and HMHP, which are formed in the aqueous ozonolysis of MACR, as shown in reaction . However, none of these products were detected in the experiment. Therefore, when α-pinene is in excess in the solution, the 40% yield represents the actual MACR yield in the aqueous ozonolysis of α-pinene. In the α-pinene–O3 system, H2O2 and MACR were both detected. Whether the existence of H2O2 influences the stability of MACR should be considered. The mixture of H2O2 (11.4 μM) and MACR (4.60 μM) in the presence of sulphuric acid (pH = 2.0, 3.0, 7.0) was prepared and kept in darkness at 298 K for 2 h. shows their temporal concentration profiles, indicating no obvious variation of MACR. Using the detection limit of MACR 0.05 μM, the upper limit of the reaction rate of H2O2 and MACR can be estimated as 6.9 × 10−12 M s−1 under the experimental conditions in this study. Accordingly, based on this rate value and the concentrations of H2O2 and MACR, the upper limit of the corresponding rate constant can be obtained as 0.13 M−1 s−1. Since the loss of MACR due to the existence of H2O2 was to be minor, the calculated yield ∼40% based on the determined concentrations represents the actual yield of MACR in aqueous ozonolysis of α-pinene. 3.4.2</text>

      <text>HCHO was not found in the α-pinene–O3 system. This is inconsistent with previous studies on gas-phase reactions. detected the formation of HCHO in the gas-phase α-pinene–O3 reaction with sufficient water vapor, with a yield of 13.9%. Other studies have also found varying amounts of HCHO in the gas-phase ozonolysis of α-pinene–O3, with a yield ranging from 5% to 28% ( ). The possible process leading to the formation of HCHO in gas-phase ozonolysis of α-pinene includes the decomposition of a carbonyl-substituted Criegee intermediate which possesses excess energy. Then HCHO, OH radicals, and organic radicals are produced ( ). However, since HCHO was not detected in the aqueous phase, this indicates that the gas-phase reaction pathways are not applicable to the aqueous phase because the Criegee intermediate would immediately stabilize in surroundings rich with water, so that there would be very little decomposition of excessively energetic Criegee intermediate. Thus, the reaction between the Criegee intermediate and water will dominate in the aqueous phase. Unlike the system with α-pinene, HCHO was detected in the β-pinene–O3 system with a yield of ∼60%. It was believed that HCHO is a first generation product in the β-pinene–O3 system, formed by the decomposition of the molozonide ( ). As described in Section , there is only one decomposition pathway for the β-pinene molozonide. The yield of HCHO should approach 100%; however, the actual yield detected was only ∼60%. What happened to the remaining ∼40% of HCHO? It is accepted that a stabilized Criegee intermediate undergoes an addition to carbonyls to form secondary ozonides ( ), as shown in reactions . (4) (5) However, although this HCHO sink provides some information about the fate of HCHO, it can not explain the nearly 100% yield of H2O2 observed in the β-pinene–O3 system; this is because the reaction can not produce H2O2. It is well known that HCHO undergoes hydrolysis to yield the gem-diol, methylene glycol ( ), as shown in reaction . So we suggest that the missing HCHO participates in the following reactions in the hydrate form, which then react with the Criegee intermediate to form a secondary ozonide and H2O2, as discussed in Section .

      <text>Based on the mechanism suggested for the ozonation of unsaturated compounds leading to primary molozonide formation ( ), we now propose a mechanism by which these α/β-pinene and ozone reactions occur, resulting in the formation of the observed products. The α-pinene–O3 reaction is initiated by the addition of O3 across the C C double bond. This forms an energy-rich primary molozonide which rapidly decomposes via two pathways, each of which forms a Criegee intermediate with a carbonyl oxide moiety and a carbonyl group. Water in the α-pinene–O3 system has a key role, in that the Criegee intermediate is collisionally stabilized in the water phase and then reacts rapidly with water. The unstable compound that is formed will decompose into H2O2 and pinonaldehyde. The proposed scheme of reaction is shown in . The mechanism for production of MACR in alpha-pinene ozonolysis is unclear and this needs a further study. Unlike α-pinene, β-pinene possesses a terminal double bond which changes its performance. As mentioned above, the lack of HMHP detected in this system proves that there is only one pathway for the decadence of molozonide, which forms the corresponding Criegee intermediate and HCHO. HCHO undergoes hydrolysis to yield the gem-diol, methylene glycol. In the solvent cage, the Criegee intermediate and methylene glycol recombine to form a secondary ozonide and H2O2. The Criegee intermediate otherwise will react with water, via the same pathway described above for α-pinene, thereby forming the unstable compound which decomposes to H2O2 and a carbonyl compound, as shown in . 4</text>

Assuming the concentrations of O3 and OH are 35 ppbv and 2 × 106 molecule cm−3 in the troposphere ( ), the lifetimes of α/β-pinene with respect to oxidation by O3 and OH in the gas phase can be calculated based on the corresponding reaction rate constants ( ) and their values are τα-pinene−O3=3.8h, τα-pinene−OH=2.6h, τβ-pinene−O3=21.5h, and τβ-pinene−OH=1.6h. Obviously, the possibility of α/β-pinene reacting with either O3 or OH depends on the corresponding reaction rates. Thus we calculate that the proportion of α-pinene undergoing O3 oxidation is 40%, compared to the 60% fraction undergoing OH oxidation. Similarly, the proportions of β-pinene oxidized by O3 and OH radical are 7% and 93%, respectively. Since ozone plays an important role in the transformation of α/β-pinene in the troposphere, it is necessary to evaluate the extent to which α/β-pinene undergo the aqueous ozonation. It has been recognized that the cloud processing forms SOA by oxidizing VOCs in the gas phase to produce water-soluble species, which then dissolve into water droplets and react to form low volatile products ( ). Herein we made a rough evaluation on the oxidation of α/β-pinene through cloud/fog processing. The mixing ratios of α-pinene, β-pinene and ozone in the troposphere were chosen to be 0.1 ppbv, 0.1 ppbv ( ) and 35 ppbv ( ). The concentrations of α-pinene, β-pinene and ozone in water droplets were estimated to be 5.9 × 10−12 M, 5.0 × 10−12 M, and 4.0 × 10−10 M, respectively, according to their Henry's Law Constants ( ). Then the aqueous reaction rates were calculated as 9.7 × 10−16 M s−1 for α-pinene–O3 and 8.2 × 10−16 M s−1 for β-pinene–O3, using the rate constant for aqueous ozonolysis of isoprene as a reference ( ), because of the lack of the corresponding rate constants for α/β-pinene. Choosing 1 cm3 H2O m−3 (1 g H2O m−3) air as an estimation of cloud/fog liquid water content ( ), the rates of aqueous phase removal of α and β-pinene were estimated as 9.7 × 10−19 mol s−1 m−3 air and 8.2 × 10−19 mol s−1 m−3 air. These rates are minor compared with the corresponding gas-phase reaction rates, which are estimated as 3.0 × 10−13 mol s−1 m−3 air for α-pinene–O3 and 5.3 × 10−14 mol s−1 m−3 air for β-pinene–O3 based on the their rate constants ( ). Accordingly, the ozonation of these two monoterpenes in the bulk of cloud/fog droplets seems to be insignificant. However, it is worth noting that the aqueous reaction occurs not only in the bulk but also on the surface of droplets ( ) and the latter may be more important and more ubiquitous than the former in the atmosphere, especially for the rapid reactions, such as the ozonolysis of unsaturated hydrocarbons ( ). Once the gaseous reactive molecules, such as pinene and ozone, meet the surface of water droplets, they will immediately undergo chemical reaction on the surface before they enter into the bulk of droplets. Up to date, it is unclear whether the surface reaction will be great enough to substantially alter the contribution of the aqueous reaction to the atmospheric chemistry. We suggest the ozonolysis of α/β-pinene on the surface of water droplets potentially have a considerable contribution to the transformation of these two monoterpenens in cloud/fog. α/β-pinene in cloud/fog will undergo the ozonation in three possible phases, namely, the gas phase in interstitial spaces, the surface of droplets and the bulk of droplets. The ozonolysis of α/β-pinene will produce the exited Criegee intermediate (ECI) as the first step in whatever phase, although it is difficult to estimate the relative importance of these three different phases in the transformation of these two monoterpenes. ECI either can be stabilized via collision with other molecules or decompose in a variety of ways, and then the stabilized Criegee intermediate (SCI) can immediately react with water, SO2, NO2, CO, aldehydes and ketones present there. Obviously, the cloud/fog environment provides a huge amount of water molecules in forms of droplets and vapor, and these water molecules will significantly increase the SCI yeild and dominate the SCI transformation, leading to the formation of the products observed in the present study. Therefore, we suggest that the aqueous ozonolysis of α/β-pinene proposed in the present study should be a potentially important source of H2O2, HCHO and MACR in the humid regions, where cloud/fog is ubiquitous.</text>
