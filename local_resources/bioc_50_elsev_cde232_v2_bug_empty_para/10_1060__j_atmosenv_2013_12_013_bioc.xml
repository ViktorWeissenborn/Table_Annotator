      <text>We revise the Carbon Bond chemical mechanism to explicitly represent three Stabilized Criegee Intermediates (SCIs) and their subsequent reactions with sulfur dioxide, water monomer, and water dimer, and incorporate the reactions into the Community Multiscale Air Quality model. The reaction of sulfur dioxide with SCI produces sulfuric acid which partitions into sulfate. We examine the impact of sulfur dioxide oxidation by SCI on sulfate using two different measured rate constants for the reaction of sulfur dioxide and SCI. When we use the higher rate constant and emissions estimates from the Biogenic Emissions Inventory System, it enhances monthly mean sulfate in summer by ∼20% in biogenically active areas. Enhancements are driven primarily by SCI produced from the reactions of biogenically derived alkenes and ozone. The use of the lower rate constant only marginally enhances sulfate since it is 65 times lower than the higher rate constant. We performed several sensitivity analyses to investigate the impacts of uncertain biogenic emissions and SCI loss rates. When we use the higher rate constant and emissions estimates from the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature, it enhances monthly mean sulfate by ∼75%. A simulation using the lowest reported rate constant for the reaction of SCI and water indicated the maximum enhancement of sulfate from this chemistry was up to 4 μg/m3 over a 24-h period in some locations in the Southeastern U.S. Predictions without the SCI reaction are lower than observed sulfate while predictions with the SCI reaction improve the agreements with observations.</text>

      <text>Aerosols cause adverse health impacts (Pope et al., 2002), degrade atmospheric visibility (Malm et al., 1994), and alter Earth's energy balance (Murphy et al., 2009). Sulfate (SO42−) is an important component of atmospheric aerosols, comprising up to 60% of atmospheric aerosols in the U.S. (Hand et al., 2012). SO42− primarily forms from gas- and aqueous-phase oxidation of sulfur dioxide (SO2) by various atmospheric oxidants (Seinfeld and Pandis, 2006). Gas-phase oxidation by hydroxyl radical (HO) and aqueous-phase oxidation by hydrogen peroxide are thought to produce the majority of atmospheric SO42− (Sofen et al., 2011). Calvert and Stockwell (1983) first proposed that the reactions of Stabilized Criegee Intermediate (SCI) with SO2 are important for production of organic acids and sulfate and incorporated the reactions into the Regional Acid Deposition Mechanism (Stockwell, 1986). These studies found that SCI intermediates could be important oxidants for SO2 at high VOC to NOx ratios (VOC = Volatile Organic Compounds and NOx = Oxides of Nitrogen) and at low relative humidity. Recent laboratory and field experiments () more strongly show that Criegee Intermediates can oxidize SO2 to SO42−. Welz et al. (2012) studied the reaction of SO2 and formaldehyde oxide (CH2OO) using direct measurement technique and measured a rate constant of 3.9 × 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 for the reaction. This value is greater than any other previously reported rate constant. They suggested that SO2 oxidation by Criegee Intermediates can enhance SO42− by as much as SO2 oxidation by the HO pathway. Mauldin et al. (2012) reported a lower rate constant of 6.0 × 10−13 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 for the oxidation of SO2 by Criegee Intermediate though they used different Criegee Intermediates than the study of Welz et al. (2012). They suggested that oxidation of SO2 by HO alone could not explain the observed SO42− in a boreal forest in Finland. However, the oxidation of SO2 by HO and SCI was sufficient to explain the SO42− observed in their measurements in boreal forests. Carlsson et al. (2012) performed experiments in a static variable pressure reaction chamber to study particle formation during ozonolysis of β-pinene and 2-butene. They measured rate constant similar to the value reported by Welz et al. (2012) and suggested that it provides a reliable estimate for substituted and larger SCI. Taatjes et al. (2013) directly measured rate constants for the oxidation of SO2 by two conformers of acetaldehyde oxide (syn-CH3CHOO and ant-CH3CHOO). They also reported high rate constant (similar to the findings of Welz et al., 2012) and suggested that ant-CH3CHOO is more reactive than syn-CH3CHOO. The impact of SO2 oxidation by SCI depends on the relative abundance of SCI (Vereecken et al., 2012). The main loss mechanism of SCI from the atmosphere is its reaction with H2O. While several recent studies directly measured the rate constant for the SCI + SO2 reaction, only Welz et al. (2012) and Taatjes et al. (2013) reported the direct measurement of the rate constant for the SCI + H2O reaction. However, they reported an upper limit, not the actual rate constant. Previous studies determined the rate constant of the SCI + H2O reaction either by indirect measurements or estimations. Indirect measurements quantified the relative rate to that of the SCI + SO2 reaction and used it to derive the rate constant for the SCI + H2O reaction. Since the rate constant of the SCI + SO2 reaction varied among different studies, the reported rate constant for the SCI + H2O reaction also varied (Hatakeyama and Akimoto, 1994). Anglada et al. (2011) and Vereecken et al. (2012) noted that the type of conformer as well as the type of substitution in the SCI affects the rate constant for the reaction of SCI and H2O. Anglada et al. (2011) used computational chemistry to study reactions of fifteen different SCIs with H2O and found that rate constants vary by ten orders of magnitude for reactions of substituent carbonyl oxides and H2O. They reported higher rate constants for the reactions for anti-conformers with H2O than the reactions of syn-conformers with H2O. When both H molecules in formaldehyde oxide were substituted by CH3, the rate constant was calculated to be ∼4 × 10−17 cm3 molecule−1 s−1; however, substituting one H molecule by CH3 and one H molecule by CH CH2 resulted in significant smaller rate constants between ∼3 × 10−19–8 × 10−18 cm3 molecule−1 s−1. Several studies suggest that the SCI loss cannot be fully accounted for with the SCI + H2O reaction alone and that reactions with water dimers are key to properly characterizing this loss. Ryzhkov and Ayiya (2004) suggested that reaction rates of SCI and water dimer [(H2O)2] are greater than those of SCI and H2O. Ryzhkov and Ayiya (2006) reported that SCI + (H2O)3 and SCI + (H2O)4 reactions proceed at much slower rates than SCI + (H2O)2 reaction [(H2O)3 = water trimer) and (H2O)4 = water tetramer]. Based on computational chemistry, Vereecken et al. (2012) calculated rate constants of the reactions of CH2OO and CH3C(H)OO with (H2O)2 to be five orders of magnitude greater than the corresponding reactions with H2O. Finally, Long et al. (2011) conducted a theoretical study and reported that experimental rate constant for SCI + H2O is inconsistent with the theoretical estimates since SCI also reacts with (H2O)2. Several studies have incorporated this chemistry into various types of models in order to quantify its effects on atmospheric SO42− concentrations. Boy et al. (2013) incorporated SCI into a zero-dimensional model and compared predictions to the measurements in VOC-rich environments from Finland and Germany. They employed reactions of SCI with other compounds [including H2O but not (H2O)2] contained in the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM). They used the Mauldin et al. (2012) reported rate constant for the SCI + SO2 reaction and suggested that the SO2 oxidation by SCI contributes up to 50% of the measured atmospheric sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Pierce et al. (2013) incorporated the Criegee chemistry into GEOS-Chem, used the Welz et al. (2012) reported rate constant for the SCI + SO2 reaction, and a rate constant of 1.6 × 10−17 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 for the SCI + H2O reaction following the MCM. They reported that it enhanced predicted global H2SO4 production by 4% with as much as 100% increase in H2SO4 concentrations in forested regions. Sarwar et al. (2013) used the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to examine the impact of SO2 oxidation by SCI on regional SO42− concentrations. They used the absolute rate constant for the SCI + SO2 reaction reported by Welz et al. (2012). In the absence of any direct measurement for the SCI + H2O reaction, they followed the suggestion of Hatakeyama and Akimoto (1994) and derived a rate constant of 2.0 × 10−15 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 for the reaction using the relative rate constant ratio. Using this value for the SCI + H2O reaction and the Welz et al. (2012) reported value for the SCI + SO2 reaction, they found that the SCI chemistry does not enhance SO42− since most SCI is lost by the reaction with H2O. However, based on a sensitivity simulation using a lower rate constant for the SCI + H2O reaction, the study concluded that the SCI + SO2 pathway would enhance SO42− under those conditions. Due to the uncertainty in the SCI + H2O rate constant, they suggested further investigation. Li et al. (2013) also applied the CMAQ model to examine the role of SCI on sulfate formation over the eastern U.S. They implemented the MCM into the CMAQ model, utilized 36-km horizontal grid-resolution, and simulated air quality for 10 summer days in 2006. When they used the higher rate coefficient for the reaction of SO2 + SCI as reported by Welz et al. (2012) and the lower rate constant for the reaction of H2O + SCI used in the MCM, mean sulfate concentration increased by up to 18% compared to those obtained with the lower rate constant for the SO2 + SCI reaction used in the MCM. However, when they used a higher rate constant for the reaction of H2O + SCI (the same value used by Sarwar et al., 2013), mean sulfate concentration increased by less than 0.5% compared to those obtained with the lower rate constant used in the MCM. The range of reported rate constants for both the SCI + SO2 and the SCI + H2O reactions and the resulting range in modeling findings suggest that more work is needed to accurately quantify the impact of this chemistry on the conversion of SO2 to SO42−. Here, we take into account the best current information on both the SCI + SO2 and SCI + H2O reaction rates to re-examine the impact of SO2 oxidation by SCI on SO42− using the CMAQ model.</text>

      <text>The impact of Criegee chemistry on SO42− concentrations is characterized by performing two sets of model simulations, one of which includes Criegee oxidation chemistry and the other does not. Differences in the results between the two simulations are attributed to the SO2 oxidation by SCI. Sarwar et al. (2013) described the details of the CMAQ v5.0.1 model (www.cmascenter.org) () which is also used in this study. The model uses the 2005 Carbon Bond chemical mechanism with updated toluene chemistry (CB05TU) (Whitten et al., 2010). Model inputs are summarized briefly here. The Weather Research and Forecasting (version 3.3) model (Skamarock et al., 2008) is used to derive meteorological fields. The Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE) model (Houyoux et al., 2000) is used to prepare model-ready emissions using the 2005 National Emissions Inventory (www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/net/2005_nei_point.pdf). The Biogenic Emissions Inventory System (BEIS) (version 3.14) is used for preparing biogenic emissions (Schwede et al., 2005). Model simulations are performed for January, July, and August, 2006. January is used as a representative winter month while July and August are used as representative summer months. The model performance statistics for O3 and PM2.5 are similar to those reported by previous investigators (); thus the model is suitable for examining the impact of the SO2 oxidation by SCI on SO42−.</text>

      <text>In previous analysis, Sarwar et al. (2013) used a single SCI to describe the impact of Criegee chemistry on SO42−. As indicated earlier, the relative importance of this chemistry depends on the abundance of different SCI species since they have vastly different removal rates from the atmosphere. Here we extend the Criegee chemistry based on MCMv3.2 (; www.mcm.leeds.ac.uk/MCM) to use three different SCIs due to their different reaction rate constants with H2O (Anglada et al., 2011). CB05TU contains 6 alkenes (ETH, OLE, IOLE, ISOP, ISPD, TERP) and their reactions with O3; SCI yields for these reactions are added to CB05TU. In addition, reactions for each of these SCIs with SO2 and H2O are added to the chemistry. These reactions are summarized in Table 1. We use CH2OO (SCI1) to represent SCI formed from both the reaction ethene (ETH) + O3 and the reaction of terminal olefins (OLE) + O3. The SCI yield for the ETH/O3 reaction described by Sarwar et al. (2013) is consistent with the value used in MCMv3.2 and is also used in this study. The yield of SCI1 formed from the reaction of OLE and O3 is also taken from Sarwar et al. (2013). SCI2 is produced from the reaction of O3 + internal olefin (IOLE), a four carbon lumped alkene chemical species. The reaction of IOLE and O3 produces an ozonide that breaks down to generate a two carbon SCI (CH3CHOO). Anglada et al. (2011) suggested two different isomers for CH3CHOO: syn-CH3CHOO and ant-CH3CHOO. They reported a rate constant of 3.23 × 10−13 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 for the reaction of ant-CH3CHOO with H2O and a rate constant of 3.23 × 10−18 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 for the reaction of syn-CH3CHOO with H2O. Here, we use syn-CH3CHOO (SCI2) to represent the SCI from IOLE/O3 reaction to minimize the loss of SCI by H2O and maximize SO42− production, and the yield described by Sarwar et al. (2013). As discussed later, the choice of the rate constant is irrelevant since its impact on SO42− production is small. Following the detailed chemistry in MCMv3.2, we supplement the CB05TU to include SCI yield of isoprene (ISOP). The reaction of ISOP and O3 produces several different SCIs including CH2OO (SCI1) and four-carbon SCIs. Several different isomers are possible for the four-carbon SCIs and rate constants of their reactions with H2O also vary. Anglada et al. (2011) described the rate constants for nine different monomers. Seven of the rate constants are on the order of ∼10−18 cm3 molecule−1 s−1, one rate constant is ∼10−13 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 while the other rate constant is ∼10−19 cm3 molecule−1 s−1. We represent the four-carbon SCI by using syn-CH3-anti-(cis-CH CH2) CHOO (SCI3) following Anglada et al. (2011). CB05TU uses a lumped species (ISPD) to represent isoprene reaction products. We use SCI3 to represent SCI from the ISPD/O3 reaction. We apply the procedure described by Carter (1996) for deriving the SCI yield from the ISPD/O3 reaction. Carter (1996) used 10% of methacrolein (MACR), 60% of methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) and 30% of unsaturated C5-aldeydes to derive parameters for ISPD/O3 reaction. We use the SCI yields in MCMv3.2 for reactions of MACR and MVK with O3. For the SCI yield of unsaturated C5-aldeyde/O3 reaction, we use the value of MACR/O3 reaction. Such assumptions have been used in developing other chemical mechanisms (Goliff et al., 2013). We follow the detailed chemistry in MCMv3.2 to refine the SCI of TERP/O3 reaction and their yields. Carter (2000) described the chemistry of TERP using weighted averaging of α-pinene, β-pinene, d -limonene, 3-carene, and sabinene. We use the SCI yields in MCMv3.2 for reactions of O3 with α-pinene, β-pinene, and d -limonene. The detailed chemistry of 3-carene is not available in MCMv3.2. Ma et al. (2009) conducted chamber experiments involving 3-carene and O3 and suggested that SCI yield of 3-carene should be lower than that of α-pinene. We use the SCI yield of α-pinene for 3-carene. The detailed chemistry of sabinene is not available. However, the structure of sabinene is similar to β-pinene so we use the SCI yield to be the same as that for β-pinene. SCI3 is used to represent SCI from the TERP/O3 reaction. For reactions of SO2 with SCI1, SCI2, and SCI3, we employ a single rate constant reported by Welz et al. (2012). For SCI1 + H2O we apply the rate constant of 2.40 × 10−15 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 (Table 1) suggested by Sarwar et al. (2013) which is two times lower than the upper limit measured by Welz et al. (2012) and slightly lower than the theoretical estimates of 3–5 × 10−15 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 reported by Anglada et al. (2011). However, this value is greater than the value of 1.0 × 10−17 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 used in MCMv3.2. For SCI2 + H2O and SCI3 + H2O we use rate constants of 3.23 × 10−18 and 1.97 × 10−18 respectively (Anglada et al., 2011). Our rate constant for SCI3 + H2O is similar to the values of 2.0–6.0 × 10−18 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 used in MCMv3.2. We also implement the reactions of SCI1, SCI2, SCI3 with (H2O)2. Vereecken et al. (2012) reported a rate constant ratio of 3.5 × 105 for the reactions of SCI1 with (H2O)2 and H2O, 1.6 × 105 for the reactions of SCI2 with (H2O)2 and H2O, and 4.1 × 102 for the reactions of SCI3 with (H2O)2 and H2O. We use these ratios to calculate rate constants for the reactions of SCI1, SCI2, and SCI3 with (H2O)2. Similar to Vereecken et al. (2012), we also constrain the estimated rate constant with a physical upper limit of 1.0 × 10−10 cm3 molecule−1 s−1. We calculate (H2O)2 using [(H2O)2] = Keq × [H2O] (Shillings et al., 2011), where Keq (0.04 atm−1) is the equilibrium constant for dimer formation (Vereecken et al., 2012). The model uses WRF predicted H2O mixing ratios. It should be noted that such reactions are not used in MCMv3.2. Previous modeling studies () did not use such reactions either. While not important, we also implement the reaction of SCI1, SCI2, and SCI3 with NO2 for completeness (rate constant taken from Welz et al., 2012). SCI can also react with other chemical species; however, they generally do not play substantial roles in affecting the fate of SCI in the atmosphere (Vereecken et al., 2012) and therefore are not considered in this study.</text>

      <text>The surface-level domain-wide monthly mean SO42− concentration obtained without the SCI reactions is 1.11 μg/m3 in January, 1.60 μg/m3 in July, and 1.59 μg/m3 in August. The oxidation of SO2 by SCI enhances the domain-wide monthly mean SO42− concentration by 0.05 μg/m3 in January, 0.10 μg/m3 in July, and 0.08 μg/m3 in August. While the SO2 oxidation by SCI enhances SO42− both in winter and summer months, it produces more SO42− in summer than in winter.</text>

      <text>Predicted monthly mean SO42− concentrations without the SCI initiated reactions and enhancements with the SCI initiated pathway are shown in Fig. 1. In winter, the SO2 oxidation by SCI increases monthly mean SO42− in the southeastern U.S. and Mexico by 0.15–0.30 μg/m3. However, it increases SO42− by 0.15–1.20 μg/m3 over a large area across the eastern U.S. during summer months. The impacts are especially pronounced in the southeastern U.S. where summertime enhancements exceed 1.0 μg/m3. Criegee chemistry leads to smaller increases in SO42− (0.15–0.3 μg/m3) in California and other areas in western U.S. during summer months. In addition to causing larger enhancements in SO42− in the summer than in the winter, Criegee chemistry also leads to increases over a more extensive geographic area during the summer than during the winter. In the model simulations, SO42− enhancements are primarily the result of the SO2 oxidation by SCI3 which is produced from the reactions of biogenic derived alkenes and O3. At 1.0 atm and 50% relative humidity, we calculate that most of SCI1 (&gt;99%) and SCI2 (&gt;90%) are lost by their reactions with H2O and (H2O)2 and thus are unavailable for reacting with SO2. In contrast, only ∼10–20% of SCI3 is lost by its reactions with H2O and (H2O)2 under similar conditions. Although not shown here, predicted SCI3 concentrations in winter are small due to low emissions of biogenic precursor VOCs. In contrast during summer, larger biogenic emissions result in much higher simulated SCI3 concentrations. While predicted summertime SCI3 concentrations are lower than HO levels, the production rates of SO42− via the SCI initiated reaction are similar to or greater than those with the HO initiated pathway. As a reference, the rate constant for the reaction of SO2 + HO at 1.0 atm and 298 K is 9.5 × 10−13 cm3 molecule−1 s−1.</text>

      <text>We examine the day-to-day variability of the SCI initiated SO42− enhancements by calculating an area-wide daily mean value over 490,000 km2 in southeastern U.S. [see black rectangle in Fig. 1d]. Predicted area-wide day-to-day variations in daily mean SO42− enhancements due to the SCI reaction are shown in Fig. 2a for July. Over this area of the Southeast, the SCI chemistry enhances daily mean summer SO42− by 0.2–1.4 μg/m3. Day to day variation in SO42− enhancements track the product of SO2 and SCI3 (r = 0.89) (Fig. 2a) which supports the conclusion that the SCI3 initiated reaction is responsible for the SO42− enhancements. Monthly average diurnal variations are shown for the same region examined for daily variations (Fig. 2b). Predicted SO42− concentrations without the SCI initiated pathway are relatively constant throughout the day. Although SO42− concentrations are enhanced by Criegee chemistry at all hours, the enhancements are greater at night. This diurnal pattern is driven by the relative availability of the two oxidants. Predicted HO concentrations are relatively small at night and peak during the day while predicted SCI3 concentrations are relatively constant. Predicted SCI3 concentrations are greater than the nighttime HO values leading to greater nighttime production rates of SO42− via the SCI initiated pathway than via the HO initiated pathway. Conversely, predicted SCI3 concentrations are substantially lower than the daytime HO values, causing daytime production rates of SO42− to come predominantly from the HO initiated pathway.</text>

      <text>Since the SCI initiated SO2 oxidation enhances more SO42− in summer, we performed two additional simulations in July using biogenic emissions inputs derived from the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (Guenther et al., 2012): one without the SCI initiated reaction and one with the SCI initiated reactions. Predicted monthly mean SO42− concentrations from the MEGAN sensitivity without the SCI initiated reaction and related enhancements are presented in Fig. 3. The domain-wide monthly mean SO42− concentration obtained without the SCI initiated reaction is 1.53 μg/m3 (slightly lower than the 1.6 μg/m3 obtained using BEIS emissions). The SCI initiated reaction enhances the domain-wide monthly mean SO42− by 0.20 μg/m3 (twice as much as the enhancement with BEIS emissions). With biogenic emissions estimates of MEGAN, the SCI initiated reaction increases SO42− concentrations by 1.2–2.4 μg/m3 in the eastern U.S., also about two times greater than the enhancements in the eastern U.S. with emissions estimates from BEIS. These differences are due to the much larger eastern U.S. biogenic emissions estimates from MEGAN than from BEIS. Pouliot and Pierce (2008) examined emissions from BEIS and MEGAN and reported that MEGAN produces 60% more isoprene emissions than those from BEIS. Carlton and Baker (2011) compared modeled isoprene concentrations to measurements in the Ozark mountains and reported that MEGAN emissions led to model over-predictions of surface isoprene while BEIS emissions led to model under-predictions of surface isoprene. Hogrefe et al. (2011) also studied the impact of biogenic emission uncertainties on ozone and fine particulate matter in eastern U.S. and reported that MEGAN estimated biogenic emissions are much greater than those estimated by BEIS. Predicted isoprene concentrations with MEGAN estimated emissions were much greater than the observed levels while predicted isoprene concentrations with BEIS estimated emissions were closer to the observed levels. The increased biogenic VOC concentrations affect SO42− chemistry in several ways. First, HO levels are somewhat depressed in the MEGAN case due to more loss via HO + VOC reactions. Predicted H2O2 levels are greater with the MEGAN case. These lead to slightly lower SO42− concentrations when no Criegee chemistry was simulated. Second, and more significantly, increased biogenic emissions lead to enhanced SCI3 levels. Collectively, these suggest that the simulated relative importance of Criegee chemistry on SO42− formation is heavily dependent on biogenic emissions estimates.</text>

      <offset>29590</offset>
      <text>We performed a series of four sensitivity simulations to investigate the impact of uncertain rate constants involving SCIs. First, an additional simulation using BEIS estimated emissions was completed with the lower rate constant reported by Mauldin et al. (2012) for the SCI3 + SO2 reaction (65 times slower than the Welz et al., 2012 value). The rate constants for SCI1 + SO2 and SCI2 + SO2 reactions are not changed for this simulation. Mauldin et al. (2012) did not report any rate constant for the reaction of SCI and H2O; thus, we assume the rate constants in Table 1 for this sensitivity. The use of the lower rate constant for the SCI3 + SO2 reaction only marginally increases SO42− concentrations. For example, daily mean SO42− concentrations without the SCI initiated reaction and enhancements obtained with the SCI initiated reaction for July 1 are shown in Fig. 4(a–b). Daily mean enhancements obtained with the lower rate constant ranged from 0.05 to 0.15 μg/m3, compared to enhancements of up to 0.3–2.6 μg/m3 in the original simulation (Fig. 4(c)). Boy et al. (2013) implied that Mauldin et al. (2012) value is not an absolute rate constant for the reaction of SCI with SO2, but rather an effective rate constant for SO42− production by the SCI reaction that already accounts for the loss with other chemical compounds. Thus, we perform a second sensitivity simulation using SCI3 + SO2 and without any reactions of SCI3 with H2O, (H2O)2, and NO2. The resulting daily mean SO42− enhancements for July 1 are shown in Fig. 4(d). This new “net” reaction rate produces SO42− enhancements that are ∼2 times greater than the enhancements obtained with the higher rate constant of Welz et al. (2012). Thus, further clarification on the use of the lower rate constant reported by Mauldin et al. (2012) is needed. Third, as indicated earlier, Anglada et al. (2011) calculated rate constants for the reactions of different SCIs and H2O. The lowest calculated value was 2.93 × 10−19 molecules cm−3 s−1. We performed another simulation by using this lowest value for the rate constant for the reaction of SCI3 and H2O and by additionally adjusting the rate constant for the reaction of SCI3 and (H2O)2. All other conditions were unchanged. Predicted daily mean sulfate enhanced by ∼1.8–4.0 μg/m3 in the southeast U.S. (Fig. 4(e)) while the enhancements obtained with the higher rate constant for SCI3 and H2O were ∼1.0–2.6 μg/m3 in the southeast U.S. (Fig. 4(c)). Thus, the use of the lower rate constant for SCI3 + H2O produces substantially greater sulfate which further emphasizes the role that the SCI3/water reaction plays in enhancing sulfate. Vereecken et al. (2012) suggested that SCIs can also undergo unimolecular decomposition and reported first order rate constants for their reactions. The fourth sensitivity simulation was performed by accounting for unimolecular decomposition of SCI1, SCI2, and SCI3 with the following first order rate constants: 0.30 s−1 for SCI1 (Fenske et al., 2000), 0.388 s−1 for SCI2 (Vereecken et al., 2012), and 0.21 s−1 for SCI3 (Vereecken et al., 2012). For this simulation, we used the lowest rate constant for the reaction of SCI3 and H2O and appropriately adjusted the rate constant for the reaction of SCI3 and (H2O)2 as was done for the previous sensitivity simulation. Predicted daily mean sulfate enhancements are shown in Fig. 4(f) and ranged between ∼1.2 and 3.5 μg/m3 in the southeast U.S. Enhancements decreased by up to ∼0.5 μg/m3 compared to the enhancements obtained with the lower rate constant for the reaction of SCI3 and H2O alone as shown in Fig. 4(e) due to the loss of SCI3 via unimolecular decomposition. This further underscores the need for accounting all important loss pathways of SCI for accurately examining the impact of SCI initiated SO2 oxidation on sulfate.</text>

      <text>Comparisons with ambient data are conducted to determine whether Criegee chemistry produces more realistic modeled SO42− concentrations. Comparisons are made between modeled and observed values at monitoring locations in the Eastern U.S. defined by the black rectangles in Figs. (d) and (b) for the BEIS and MEGAN cases, respectively. Measurements came from the Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNET), the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE), the Chemical Speciation Network (CSN), and the Southeastern Aerosol Research and Characterization (SEARCH) monitoring sites in southeastern U.S. It should be noted that CASTNET measurements are reported as weekly averages while IMPROVE and CSN measurements are reported as daily averages once every three days. SEARCH measurements are made hourly but were aggregated to 24-h averages for this analysis for comparison with other networks. Fig. 5 shows that model predictions without the SCI initiated pathway are lower than the observed data for CASTNET, IMPROVE, and CSN monitoring networks (BEIS emissions) while predictions obtained with the SCI initiated pathway generally agree better with the observed concentrations. At the SEARCH sites, the results are mixed than for the measurements made in other networks. Although the SO42− predicted in the base simulation (BEIS emissions) was generally lower than observed concentrations, there are a few time periods in which the model over-predicted SO42−. During times of model under-predictions, the SCI initiated pathway tends to improve model predictions but during the less frequent period of model over-predictions, the Criegee chemistry degrade performance slightly. Similar improvements in model performance are seen in the MEGAN case for CASTNET, IMPROVE, and CSN monitoring sites. At SEARCH sites, the Criegee chemistry sometime improved performance but also sometimes lead to model over-predictions for SO42− similar in magnitude to the under-predictions in the base simulation. In the BEIS simulations, the model underestimation of SO42− concentrations persists despite the Criegee enhancements. In contrast, this model underestimation in the MEGAN simulations is largely eliminated by the Criegee enhancements. As previously indicated, MEGAN estimated biogenic emissions are much higher than those obtained with BEIS and enhanced SO42− predictions shown in Fig. 5 are the direct result of these higher biogenic emissions estimates from MEGAN. Availability of both SO2 and SO42− measurements at the CASTNET and SEARCH sites allows an investigation into the model's ability to capture the amount of conversion from SO2 to SO42−. Figs. 6 and compare the observed and predicted mass fraction of sulfur in SO42−((32×SO4)/96)/(((32×SO2)/64)+((32×SO4)/96)) at CASTNET and SEARCH sites, respectively. Mass fractions of sulfur in SO42− without the SCI reaction are lower than the observed data which suggests missing SO2 oxidation pathways in the model. Mass fractions of sulfur in SO42− with the SCI initiated SO2 reaction are slightly greater than those obtained without the SCI reaction in the BEIS case and substantially greater in the MEGAN case. For all simulations, the addition of Criegee chemistry brings the amount of SO2 conversion closer to observations. However, the modeled mass fraction is still lower than the measured fraction, suggesting either additional missing chemical pathways or underestimates of reaction rates or oxidant concentrations. Note that iron and manganese catalyzed aqueous SO2 oxidation is already included in the model, but uncertainty in this chemical pathway or underestimated cloud presence could also contribute to the underestimated mass fraction on cloudy days when aqueous-phase chemistry is important for SO42− formation. Average cloud coverage was similar in July and August. However, cloud coverage was more prevalent in January than in July or August. In January, more cloudiness existed in north central area of the modeling domain. Predicted SO2 concentrations are generally higher than the observed values as shown by comparing the predictions of SO42− in Fig. 5 with the under-predictions of the mass fraction of sulfur in Figs. 6 and .</text>

      <text>This work examines the impact of SO2 oxidation by SCI on SO42− using two different rate constants and two different biogenic emissions estimates. When the higher rate constant is used, Criegee chemistry enhances the domain-wide monthly mean SO42− by 4.5% in winter and 5–6% in summer. However, enhancements are much larger in regions with significant biogenic VOC emissions. The use of MEGAN estimated biogenic emissions results in larger enhancements of SO42− compared to simulations using BEIS estimated emissions which also suggests the need for further evaluation of emissions estimates from the two models. Substantial uncertainty in rate constants for both the SCI + SO2 and SCI + H2O and SCI + (H2O)2 reactions lead to a wide range of possible impacts. Our results obtained with the higher rate constant reported by Welz et al. (2012) for the SO2 + SCI reaction and the lower rate constant for the H2O + SCI3 reaction reported by Anglada et al. (2011) are consistent with the suggestion of Welz et al. (2012) who noted that Criegee reactions can substantially enhance SO42−. Our results are also similar to the findings of Pierce et al. (2013) who reported that it enhances SO42− appreciably in forested regions but not in un-forested regions. Our results obtained with the BEIS emissions are consistent to the findings of Li et al. (2013) while impacts obtained with the MEGAN emissions are greater than the Li et al. (2013) results. However, these new findings contrast to those reported by Sarwar et al. (2013), who found that Criegee reactions minimally enhance SO42−. The driver for these different findings is the use of different rate constant for SCI3 + H2O reaction. Our results with the lower rate constant reported by Mauldin et al. (2012) for the SO2 + SCI reaction and the lower rate constant for the H2O + SCI3 reaction reported by Anglada et al. (2011) are different than the findings of Mauldin et al. (2012) and Boy et al. (2013) who reported that this reaction substantially enhances SO42− in Finland and Germany. Possible reasons for such inconsistent results include differences in the model used in the two studies, differences in the rate constant used for the H2O + SCI3 reaction, and not accounting for the loss of SCI3 by the reaction with (H2O)2. When we use the lower rate constant reported by Mauldin et al. (2012) for the SO2 + SCI reaction without any loss of SCI3 by water, it enhances SO42− which warrants clarification on the use of the lower rate constant reported by Mauldin et al. (2012). Results of this and other recent studies suggest that the SO2 oxidation by SCI enhances SO42− when both SO2 and biogenically derived SCI are simultaneously present. Such enhancements occur due to the use of the high rate constant for the SO2 + SCI reaction and the low rate constant for the H2O + SCI3 reaction. While the high rate constant for the SO2 + SCI reaction has been measured, the low rate constant for the H2O + SCI3 reaction is based on theoretical study (Anglada et al., 2011). We believe the results presented, herein, are the upper limit of the impact of the SO2 oxidation by SCI since a low rate constant for the H2O + SCI3 reaction was used and hope this study motivates others to measure rate constant for the H2O + SCI3 reaction.</text>
