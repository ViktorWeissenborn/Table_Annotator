      <text>► An empirical model can be used to predict the distribution of degradation byproducts during ozonation of pentachlorophenol. ► Empirical rate constants are dependent on the molar ratio of ozone to pentachlorophenol. ► Pentachlorophenol degradation is most sensitive to the decomposition rate of coupling products. Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is a highly toxic material. It is hydrophobic and is recalcitrant to biological degradation. Improper use of PCP has caused serious soil and groundwater contamination problems worldwide, and posed threat to water reclamation processes. The objective of this study was to understand the effects of ozonation on the distributions of ring intermediates during the initial stage of oxidation reactions. Experiments were designed and conducted in a homogeneous condition. Molar ratios of ozone to PCP were controlled in the range from 0.05 to 1.3 at pH 6 to examine dosage effects. Three major ring intermediates quantified were tetrachloro-p-hydroquinone (TCHQ), tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone (TCBQ), and tetrachlorocatechol (TCCA). Transient distributions of these three compounds, together with chloride ions, were monitored. A degradation pathway was proposed and a set of kinetic equations was written accordingly. Rate constants in the kinetic model were obtained by optimizing against experimental data. Ozone dosage was found to be a factor controlling byproducts distributions. Finally, the dynamic sensitivities of rate constants were evaluated for each compound to understand their specific behaviors.</text>

      <text>Pentachlorophenol (PCP), a highly chlorinated phenolic compound, has been widely used as a wood preservative and biocide. Due to improper use of the chemical, it has been widely spread in contaminated soils, hazardous waste sites, and waters. Owing to its toxic and carcinogenic nature, PCP is on the US EPA's list of priority pollutants and subject to a stringent maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 0.001 mg/L set for drinking water. Some of the more toxic compounds such as polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans are potential combustion products of PCP. PCP is one of the important micropollutants that need to be removed during water reclamation processes. Ozonation treatment, both in indirect and direct reaction modes, has been proved to be effective in abating various organic pollutants Since the nature of degradation byproducts during any treatment process was of great concern to environmental health, World Health Organizations have now established MCLs not only for parent compounds per se but also for their degradation byproducts in various stages and forms of water treatment The goal of this study was to establish a model to predict transient distributions of various byproducts pertinent to the ozonation reaction, exemplified by PCP, under various ozone dosages. Due to the complexity of the oxidation pathway and the potentially unknown reactions involved, the pathway was developed empirically according to product information obtained from the literatures as mentioned above 2</text>

      <text>Stock solution of PCP with a concentration of 66 mg/L at pH 6 was prepared. A portion of the stock solution was diluted to 3 mg/L, controlled at pH 6 by phosphate salts as buffer, and then used as the starting solution for ozonation experiments. To prepare stable solution of dissolved ozone, 500 mL of the deionized water was taken to a 1 L flask, acidified to pH 2, and chilled to 4 °C in a water bath. Subsequently, ozone gas from an ozone generator (Model OZ2BTU-SS, Ozotech, USA) at selected concentrations were rigorously purged into the solution through a diffuser to produce desired concentrations of dissolved ozone, which had insignificant decomposition within 2 min during our experiment. The homogeneous chemical oxidation between dissolved ozone and aqueous PCP was initiated by mixing 5 mL of PCP solution and 5 mL of dissolved ozone with a selected concentration in a 10 mL bottle, and was terminated at different times by adding a drop of 0.01 M Na2S2O3 solution. Eight identical sets of the above two solutions were prepared, initiated, and terminated at 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 120 s, respectively, to obtain a complete set of kinetic data. To test for the effects of ozone concentration on the degradation byproducts, experiments using four different molar ratios (i.e., 1.3, 1.0, 0.5, and 0.1) of ozone to PCP were carried out. Concentrations of PCP, and three ring byproducts, including tetrachloro-p-hydroquinone (TCHQ), tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone (TCBQ), and tetrachlorocatechol (TCCA) were analyzed by HPLC (Model PU-1580, Jasco, Japan) using the Zorbax SB-C18 column (Agilent Technologies, USA) with the UV detector (Model UV-1570, Jasco, Japan). The mobile phase in HPLC consisted of the following time-dependent ratios of methanol in 0.8% aqueous phosphoric acid: 50% (0–5 min), 62% (6–13 min), 75% (14–20 min), 85% (21–30 min), and 50% (31–45 min). Chloride ions were analyzed by IC (Model DX-120, Dionex, USA) using the AS9-CH column (Dionex, USA). 3</text>

      <text>The major degradation pathways of PCP, leading to the above three ring byproducts, during ozonation were proposed as shown in . The route in the pathway from PCP to E in was a simplified one called the anomalous route, representing a series of side pathways and reactions that were not considered in this investigation such as oxidative coupling reactions. Namely, a single reaction rate constant k4 was used to reflect the combined reaction rates of multiple parallel reactions. In addition, rate constants k5, k6, and k7 represent the rates of subsequent degradation of TCHQ, TCBQ, and TCCA, respectively. With the proposed pathways in and the assumption that the reaction between each compound and dissolved ozone was second-order, pertinent chemical equations describing the reaction of each compound in can be written as below: (1) d[PCP]dt=−(k1+k2+k3+k4)[PCP][O3] (2) d[TCHQ]dt=k1[PCP][O3]−k5[TCHQ][O3] (3) d[TCBQ]dt=k2[PCP][O3]−k6[TCBQ][O3] (4) d[TCCA]dt=k3[PCP][O3]−k7[TCCA][O3] (5) d[E]dt=k4[PCP][O3]−k8[E][O3] (6) d[O3]dt=−v1(k1+k2+k3)[PCP][O3]−v2k4[PCP][O3]−v3k5[TCHQ][O3]−v3k6[TCBQ][O3]−v3k7[TCCA][O3]−v4k8[E][O3] (7) d[Cl−]dt=(k1+k2+k3+v5k4)[PCP][O3] The vi values in Eqs. are stoichiometric coefficients between ozone and various reactants, representing the moles of ozone consumed each mole of PCP and other reactants degraded. It was assumed that the coefficients between ozone and PCP towards TCHQ, TCBQ, and TCCA, i.e., the routes via k1, k2, and k3 in , were identical and assigned as v1. In the anomalous route, the coefficient of v2 was assigned. In addition, pathways via k5, k6, and k7 were assumed to have the same coefficient and assigned as v2. With respect to the generation of chloride ion, the routes via k1, k2, and k3 all release one chloride ion in each, and a unity coefficient was assigned. In the route via k4, a coefficient of v5 was used to account for the overall release of chloride ion in anomalous reactions. Consequently, a total of five stoichiometric values (v1–v5) were used in the modeling. In solving the system of equations above, the numerical scheme of Runge–Kutta was employed. Meanwhile, rate constants of k1 through k8 were optimized against experimental data by the direct method 4</text>

      <text>(a) demonstrates HPLC–UV chromatograms of one of the standards. It was evident that PCP and three byproducts were well separated by our HPLC method. In addition, (b) shows one of the chromatograms under a specific reaction time and molar ratio. Through the calibration curves constructed from the standards, concentrations of PCP together with three byproducts at various reaction times were quantified. As shown in (b), there were no other noticeable peaks in the chromatogram. This implied that these three compounds were probably the major quantifiable byproducts. Concentrations of other products were too low to be determined at this early period of ozonation reaction. As shown in Eqs. , for the proposed model to be workable a total of 13 parameters, including eight rate constants (k1–k8) plus five stoichiometric coefficients (v1–v5), had to be optimized against the experimental data. As mentioned earlier in Benitez's study show both experimental and model fitting results of PCP degradation together with the generation of major and minor byproducts, respectively, under the molar ratio of O3 to PCP of 1.3. The model fitting results in these figures were obtained by employing optimized rate constants in the kinetic pathways ( ). summarizes optimized rate constant values at four different O3 to PCP molar ratios. Among three ring byproducts we monitored, TCBQ was the most abundant and accounted for nearly 20% of the mass of PCP degraded as shown in . On the other hand, TCHQ and TCCA were considered to be minor, and each consisted of less than 5% of the mass of degradation as seen in . Also, it is evident that the anomalous route represented by E in , played the most significant role in the overall degradation of PCP since this route accounted for nearly 70% of the PCP mass degraded. This observation agrees with results obtained from the study of other chlorophenols did not represent the distribution of a single compound, but the sum of various unidentified products. It is believed that there are numerous such unidentified products. Thus, the specific concentration of each of them would actually be low. This is why there were no other significant peaks except the ones we quantified in the LC-UV chromatograms. Consequently, the three ring products quantified and modeled here could be considered as the major routes despite that they accounted for only 30% of the carbon mass degraded. The agreements between experimental and simulated data were quantified using chi-squared, χ2, test. This test compared observed values with modeled values at the same time to determine the goodness of fit between the two data sets. The χ2 test requires a null hypothesis which, in this case, presumes zero difference between modeled and experimental results. In order to obtain a sufficiently large representation of the χ2 distribution, the data were normalized in a way so that the minimum value in a data set is greater than 5. For the five compounds we monitored, there were 7 time-dependent data points in each. Therefore, the computed χ2 value for the total of 35 paired data, corresponding to 34 degrees of freedom, was 52.8. The critical value of χcv2 with a chance of 1% of rejecting the null hypothesis is 56.0. Thus, χ2&lt;χcv2 asserts that the null hypothesis is not rejected under the α0.0134 condition and concludes the absence of a systematic error in data fitting. It is worth mentioning that behaviors of kinetic data obtained from this experiment are different from a regular ozonation system, where dissolved ozone is continuously supplied from the gaseous ozone. In a regular system, concentrations of intermediate byproducts normally accumulate and then gradually decline due to further oxidation by dissolved ozone. However, in our system the dissolved ozone reacted mainly with PCP, and afterwards remained at a very low concentration, which resulted in insignificant degradation rates of various byproducts. This was why TCBQ, TCHQ, and TCCA in remained nearly constant after 20 s. When the molar ratio of O3 to PCP decreased to 1.0, their optimized rate constants and the χ2 value were determined by the same approach as above and are listed in . Although optimized values between different molar ratios of 1.3 and 1.0 were not identical, they were found to be within the same order of magnitude. Anomalous reactions were considered to be the main contributor to cause variations for each specific rate constant obtained from model fitting. Rate constants of PCP with ozone are pH-dependent because the reactivity for the dissociated and un-dissociated species with ozone is quite different. The dissociated forms are generally more reactive towards oxidants than the un-dissociated ones (8) d[PCP]dt=kobs[O3][PCP]tot=kPCP−[O3][PCP−]+kPCP[O3][PCP] where kobs is the rate constant for the overall ozonation reaction, kPCP− and kPCP are rate constants for the dissociated and un-dissociated PCP, respectively. Since the degree of dissociation (α) is defined as α = [PCP−]/([PCP−] + [PCP]) = [PCP−]/[PCP]tot. Meanwhile, the relationship between α and the pH is α = 1/(1 + ([H + ]/Ka)). Therefore, the value of kobs can be written as (9) kobs=αkPCP−+(1−α)kPCP which allows the prediction of the overall rate constant kobs at any pH once values of kPCP− and kPCP are known. Two other independent studies have found the values of kPCP− and kPCP to be 2.5 × 107 M−1 s−1 becomes 2.4 × 107 M−1 s−1. The kobs values from our study for different molar ratios were obtained by summing rate constants from k1 to k4, and are listed at the bottom row in . It is evident that our fitted values were all within a reasonable range as that obtained from the above calculation. 4.2</text>

      <text>Effects of ozone to PCP molar ratio</text>

      <text>When the molar ratio further decreased to 0.5, very different behaviors of TCHQ, and TCBQ distributions were found as shown in , respectively. Both TCHQ and TCBQ were not detected at all below the ratio of 0.5. This implied that the oxidation mechanisms and pathways were dependent on the molar ratio. Due to the absence of TCHQ and TCBQ, pathways via k1 and k2 were not considered at the ratios below 0.5 in the kinetic modeling, and only four rate constants were now needed to describe the degradation of PCP under these conditions of low molar ratios. Their fitted rate constants, together with their χ2 and kobs values, are listed in . Despite the difference in the pathway, the fitted k3 and the final kobs values for the low molar ratios were comparable to those for the high ratios. The main reason causing this was the significantly large k7 and k8 values obtained in the low ratio conditions, which to some degree compensate for the absence of the other two rate constants. As seen in , the difference for these values (i.e., k7 and k8) between these two groups is about two to three orders of magnitude. This implied that the degradation products of TCCA ( ) and E are different between different molar ratio levels. At high molar ratios, TCCA and E had low reaction rate constants, and vice versa. Formation of TCHQ, TCBQ, and TCCA is mainly due to electrophilic ozone attack, which tends to occur at the ortho-and para-positions as a result of the resonance donation of the oxygen atom In theory, the intrinsic rate constants should be independent of the reactant concentrations. However, fitted rate constants from this investigation were found to vary with molar ratios of ozone to PCP. It should be emphasized that ozonation reactions involved under the pH 6 included both direct and indirect reactions. With respect to direct reactions, their rate constants were believed to be independent of the molar ratios. But this was not the case for indirect reactions, where the degree of their reactions (e.g., oxidative coupling reactions) could be affected by the ozone dosage applied. Thus, rate constants we obtained from data fitting were essentially empirical ones, representing a combination of both direct and indirect reactions. In other words, the term of dissolved ozone concentration (i.e., [O3]) in the kinetic equations could be considered as a lumped parameter, which was proportional to the combined magnitude of direct as well as indirect reactions. When the degrees of indirect reactions increased at lower molar ratios (i.e., 0.5 and 0.1), rate constants pertinent to indirect reactions became larger, which caused a smaller degree of direct reactions and resulted in smaller rate constants. This explained why the fitted rate constants were dependent on molar ratios. Such empirical rate constants were of great value in field applications, where direct and indirect reactions normally occurred simultaneously. In fact, this empirical model developed here is subject to expand and to include other reaction routes once a thorough reaction pathway is established. 4.3</text>

      <text>Sensitivity analysis on fitted rate constants</text>

      <text>Sensitivity analyses of each rate constant under various molar ratios were carried out using methods outlined in the kinetic modeling section. demonstrates the results at a specific molar ratio of 1.3 with respect to each compound. The degree of sensitivity was quantified by the gradient or derivative of the compound concentration (Ci) with respect to a specific rate constant (ki) as dCi/dk1. If the gradient for a particular constant is large, it is sensitive, meaning that a slight change of the constant value would invoke significant concentration changes on compounds pertinent to this rate constant. shows plotted gradients as a function of rate constant and reaction time in contours to examine the dynamic sensitivity of each rate constant with respect to compounds included in the kinetic model. Prior to examining results in , it should be noted that since the gradients can have positive or negative values, it is the absolute value that one should consider in comparing the sensitivity. In general, the sensitivity for all rate constants was not strongly dependent on the reaction time as illustrated in that most contour bands remained quite parallel to the y-axis except for the rate constants of k8 and k6. On the other hand, the dependence of sensitivity on rate constants was evident. In the case of PCP, k8 was the most sensitive rate constant and its sensitivity grew as the reaction time increased. As shown in , k4 was the largest rate constant and the route via k4 essentially accounted for over 70% of the PCP mass degraded. It was evident that since the value of k4 was so large that any further increase on its value would not significantly contribute to PCP degradation. On the contrary, the subsequent degradation via k8 became the most sensitive parameter since its increase would result in the decrease of E, which could connectively facilitate further degradation of PCP. However, in the cases of TCHQ, TCBQ, and TCAA, it was evident that all of them were most sensitive to the rate constants pertinent to their own formations. With respect to TCBQ, it was also slightly sensitive to k6, the rate constant of its degradation. Finally, ozone was found to be most sensitive to the rate constant of k8, but less as sensitive for values from k1 to k7. The reason for the high sensitivity of k8 for ozone is analogous to that for PCP. In fact, it could be inferred from our analyses that the route via k8 was the rate limiting step for both PCP degradation and ozone consumption. 5</text>

      <text>The set of kinetic equations proposed in this study were able to describe experimental data obtained from pure aqueous phase reactions between ozone and PCP. Rate constants with respect to each specific pathway were determined from model fitting. The molar ratio of ozone to PCP was found to have effects on the degradation pathway. When the molar ratio was greater than 1.0, TCHQ, TCBQ, and TCCA were found to be the major ring byproducts. However, when the ratio was less than 1.0, TCHQ and TCBQ were no longer present. It was suspected that the degree of anomalous reactions and oxidative coupling reactions were the main factors contributing to this dosage-dependent behavior. Future experiments need to be conducted to understand the mechanisms of the ozone dosage effects, and to identify chemical structures of unidentified products. The empirical model established in this study could be very useful in field applications, where direct and indirect reactions normally occur simultaneously. From sensitivity analysis, the rate constant k8 was found to be the most sensitive one among eight parameters in controlling PCP degradation.</text>
