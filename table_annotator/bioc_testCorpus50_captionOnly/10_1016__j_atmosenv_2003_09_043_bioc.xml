      <text>Measurements of the dry deposition velocity of O3 to material samples of calcareous stone, concrete and wood at varying humidity of the air, were performed in a deposition chamber. Equilibrium surface deposition velocities were found for various humidity values by fitting a model to the time-dependent deposition data. A deposition velocity-humidity model was derived giving three separate rate constants for the surface deposition velocities, i.e. on the dry surface, on the first mono-layer of adsorbed water and on additional surface water. The variation in the dry air equilibrium surface deposition velocities among the samples correlated with variations in effective areas, with larger effective areas giving higher measured deposition velocities. A minimum for the equilibrium surface deposition velocity was generally measured at an intermediate humidity close to the humidity found to correspond to one mono-layer of water molecules on the surfaces. At low air humidity the equilibrium surface deposition velocity of O3 was found to decrease as more adsorbed water prevented direct contact of the O3 molecules with the surface. This was partly compensated by an increase as more adsorbed water became available for reaction with O3. At high air humidity the equilibrium surface deposition velocity was found to increase as the mass of water on the surface increased. The deposition velocity on bulk de-ionised water at RH=90% was an order of magnitude lower than on the sample surfaces.</text>

      <text>Tropospheric ozone has potential negative health effects and can deteriorate valuable materials. This has been described by several researchers ( ; ; ; ). described the factors affecting indoor ozone concentrations. Deposition to, and decomposition on, indoor surfaces significantly reduces the indoor ozone concentration from that present outdoors. The deposition velocity of ozone on various indoor building materials has been measured in flow reactors and experimental chambers of various designs ( ; ; ). A high deposition velocity may be wanted to reduce indoor ozone concentrations if hazardous compounds are not produced, and results from deposition velocity measurements can serve as one guideline in the choice of building materials. presented a methodology for measuring total and surface deposition velocities, and for modelling the time-dependent deposition of ozone to various building materials. The measurement of near equilibrium values and modelling of equilibrium values for the deposition velocities were discussed. This article will discuss the second-order dependence of the ozone deposition velocity to material surfaces on O3 air concentration and on the surface coverage of water or a reactive species proportional to the water coverage. Modelled equilibrium values for the surface deposition velocity of O3 at varying relative humidity (RH) of the air will be presented. A hypothesis as to how the observed humidity dependence of the equilibrium surface deposition velocity can be understood and modelled for some materials will be presented and discussed. The model is based on a number of simplifying assumptions, but gives a semi-quantitative explanation of how humidity affects the ozone deposition. The model would make predictions of humidity dependent deposition velocities of O3, based on chemical principles, possible over a continuous range of humidity. This is of interest in modelling indoor O3 concentrations. It is then essential to know the O3 deposition velocity in the actual indoor setting. 2</text>

      <text> hypothesised that when dangling or unsaturated carbon bonds are not present, “enough water may be associated with accumulated particles on soiled indoor surfaces that the dominant decomposition pathway for ozone is water-assisted dissociation.” The heterogeneous decomposition mechanism for O3 is supposed to be initiated by an elementary reaction with the hydroxide ion, OH−, in alkaline solution or reaction with water, H2O, in acidic solution ( ). Rate constants for the alkaline decomposition reaction and for the acidic decomposition in distilled water, were reported by . The O3 deposition velocities measured at high air humidity in this work were much too high to be explained by these rate constants given the low solubility of O3 and the very thin water films present on surfaces. This can be explained by the different nature of the heterogeneous surface reaction of O3 in the surface water from that of dissolved O3 in the distilled water. In the heterogeneous reaction the O3 molecules hit a surface with some water adsorbed on it. Some O3 molecules may decompose on the surface to O2 and O atoms, which could recombine directly to O2. The adsorbed surface water that could react with O3 would have different characteristics from those of bulk water. In addition other surface species dissolved in surface water at higher air humidity could affect the O3 reaction with adsorbed OH− ions or H2O molecules. Dissolved transition metal ions such as Mn2+ and Fe2+ may catalyse heterogeneous O3 decomposition. Surface reactions of O3 with unsaturated carbon bonds in organic materials ( ) and with dangling carbon bonds ( ) have been reported, but were considered not to happen on the materials used in this work. The surface water may be acidic or alkaline depending on the material. On the untreated wood board sample used in this work one would expect slightly acidic surface water. On the calcareous stone and concrete samples one would expect alkaline surface water. As a simplifying assumption in the modelling performed in this work the mass of OH− in surface water is set to be proportional to the mass of surface water. The rate constants for the possible reaction of O3 with OH− is then simply derived by multiplying the rate constants found for the reaction of O3 with water with a constant=0.018×10(pH-14). The activity of the surface water is then set equal to 55.6, and the OH− concentration is determined by the pH in the surface water. Henceforth, when OH− is not the subject in the discussion, only the reaction of O3 with water will be described. However, it should be kept in mind that this may be a reaction partly or wholly with OH− ions in alkaline surface water. The water molecules directly in contact with the material surface would be bonded to the surface as an adsorbed mono-layer. The water molecules in the next two mono-layers would be progressively less bonded and beyond that the properties of the water in the surface film would approach those of bulk water ( ). Probably O3 reacts on a surface with a continuum of more or less strongly bonded water molecules. As a simplification it is assumed here that ozone reacts with the dry surface, with directly adsorbed water and with additional surface water, as three separate sinks. It is further assumed that the equilibrium surface deposition velocity at a given air humidity can be expressed as a weighed mean of two of the above mentioned sinks. The sizes of the two sinks depend on the humidity of the air and the resulting thickness of the surface water film determined from the BET isotherm. 2.2</text>

      <text>The usual expression for the deposition velocity of a gas on a surface is (see e.g. ): (1) r=v d C ch , where r is the total reaction rate (ng cm−2 s−1), vd is the deposition velocity (cm s−1), Cch is the gas concentration in the deposition chamber (ng cm−3). vd=vs, the surface deposition velocity, when vd is small and the transport resistance in the air ≈0. showed that vs could probably be expressed as a pseudo-first-order rate constant for heterogeneous O3 decomposition at constant humidity and pH, in agreement with the first-order dependence found by several researchers (e.g. ; ). The total deposition rate is humidity dependent. The humidity range will be divided into one of low humidity and one of high humidity. The low humidity range will be defined from dry air to the humidity giving exactly one mono-layer of water on the material surface according to the BET isotherm. Higher values constitute the high humidity range. The BET isotherm gives the numbers of mono-layers of a gaseous species physisorbed on a surface as a function of its vapour pressure, which for water is given by the relative air humidity, and as a function of its bond strength to the surface (see e.g. ). A simple mathematical model describing the humidity dependence of the total heterogeneous reaction rate of O3 on material surfaces will be derived here. The model is based on the assumption that H2O molecules are fully adsorbed in the first mono-layer on a surface. Designating the number of mono-layers of water on a surface m, the amount of fully adsorbed water would then vary from 0 to m=1, while the mass of additional surface water would vary from 0 to m−1 (m&gt;1). In the low humidity range ozone may react with both the dry surface and with directly adsorbed water. Assuming one reaction rate constant for each of the two surface sinks, the total surface deposition velocity with varying air humidity and mass of adsorbed surface water may be written as: (2) v s =K dry (1−m)+K ads m, where m⩽1 is the number of mono-layers of water calculated from the BET isotherm. Kdry is the reaction rate constant on the dry surface, equal to vs at RH=0% (cm s−1), Kads is the reaction rate constant on adsorbed water, equal to vs at m=1 (cm s−1). The surface deposition velocity in the high humidity range is hypothesised to be directly proportional to the amount of surface water. Adsorbed ozone may react both with the first mono-layer of fully adsorbed water and with the additional surface water. The rate with the fully adsorbed water, Kads, would then be a constant as one mono-layer of water is adsorbed directly on the surface in the whole range. The total rate with the additional surface water would be a function, f (m−1), of the mass of water that is not directly adsorbed on the surface. The activity of the additional water is likely to change from the inner to the outer mono-layers as the properties of the water change from those of adsorbed water to those of bulk water. However, in the model it is assumed that the reaction rate with this water has a fixed value over all the additional mono-layers of water, different from that of the fully adsorbed surface water. A reaction rate constant can then be assumed for the additional surface water and the total surface deposition velocity in the high humidity range would only depend on the mass of surface water, with m&gt;1: (3) v s =K ads +K wet (m−1), where Kwet is the reaction rate constant for additional surface water (cm s−1). Kdry in should be a true first-order rate constant if the reaction is uni-molecular decomposition of O3. All the three constants are second order when they determine the rate of reaction of O3 with H2O. It could be argued that Kads and Kwet are pseudo-first-order constants at constant humidity with a constant amount of adsorbed water on the surface. Some variability in the “constants” depending on the humidity may be expected as the changes in the properties of the absorbed water, OH− ions and other species with increasing air humidity would not be fully represented by the mass increase of the water. The changing surface water coverage in the range from 0 to 1 mono-layer of adsorbed water and changing properties of the inner mono-layer as more water adds on to the surface could change Kads. Changes in the activity of water, OH− ions and/or other active species in the adsorbed water, as the thickness of the water layer increases above one mono-layer in the high humidity range, would change Kwet. One should be aware of these possible limitations when the modelling is evaluated. Curve fitting was performed for the whole humidity range using for m⩽1, and for m&gt;1. Kdry was found as the equilibrium surface deposition velocity measured at RH=0%. That is Kdry=vs,eq.,RH=0%. Kads is the equilibrium surface deposition velocity at intermediate humidity of the air, at m=1. Kads was found from curve fitting to the experimental data. Kwet is an equilibrium surface deposition velocity per mono-layer of additional surface water, having a thickness of ≈0.3×10−9 m. Kwet was found from the equilibrium surface deposition velocity at RH=90% using and the value of Kads found from curve fitting. The curve fitting of the model was performed manually by changing the parameter for the adsorption enthalpy, the bonding strength, of water to the surface in the mathematical expression for the BET isotherm. This determined the relative air humidity where the surface would be covered with one mono-layer of adsorbed water, m=1 in , and gave the value of Kads. The position of Kads, turned out to correspond to the minimum equilibrium surface deposition velocity in all the model curves ( ). 3</text>

      <text>The experimental set up and procedure were as explained in detail by . The experiments presented here were performed at varying RH of the air. Different amounts of dry and wet air were mixed using flow meters to give a RH of 0%, 30%, 50%, 70%, or 90% in the deposition chamber. Measurements were made at 22(±0.5)°C for all the samples. All samples were conditioned for 24 h at the humidity of the subsequent run. For one sample, the Hard Concrete Floor Tile, no. 5, measurements were made over the whole humidity range at both 22°C and 30°C, and one experiment was made on a sample pre-dried at 110°C for 24 h. before measuring O3 deposition at RH=0%. Different samples were used in each experiment, e.g. for each value of RH. In one run the deposition velocity was measured at RH=90% and T=22°C on de-ionised bulk water covering the bottom of a flat glass baker. The measured O3 concentration reduction in the empty chamber increased from 0 ppb at 0% RH to 1 ppb at 50% RH. The same value was found at higher RHs. Measured values were corrected for this deposition. vt in the chamber was measured to ≈0.75 cm s−1. A constant vd≈vs=0.07 cm s−1 was measured for one sample over a range of air velocities. The total deposition velocities measured were so small (&lt; 0.1 cm s−1) that they could be regarded as near surface velocities little influenced by transport resistance in the air ( ). 3.2</text>

      <text>Besides using the BET isotherm to model water adsorbed on the sample surfaces the BET isotherm was used to calculate the areas of the samples at the molecular level. A standard set up for measuring N2 adsorption on the dried and evacuated materials was used. The real(BET) areas were calculated in a standard procedure of curve fitting of the N2 adsorption data to the BET isotherm. The N2 adsorption measurements were performed on 45 small pieces of the samples, cubes of 0.3×0.3×0.3 cm3 for each sample. The measurements gave values for the real exposed areas of these small pieces per geometric area, Areal/Ageom (m2real m−2geometric). The actual real exposed areas of the individual samples at different air humidity were not measured directly. 3.3</text>

      <text>The recorded results were curves of O3 concentration in the airflow out of the chamber against time. The results used in the modelling and discussion of the humidity dependence of the O3-deposition, were the estimated equilibrium surface deposition velocities ( ). The values were obtained using a model that includes Langmuir adsorption, desorption, surface reaction and diffusion into the material. A simpler two parameter model including only direct reaction and diffusion into the material gave significantly better fit in the end phase after the O3 generator was turned off and it was concluded in that this model gave the more correct description of the reaction mechanism. The four-parameter Langmuir model did however generally give better curve fits to the experimental time-dependent surface deposition throughout the runs and thus a better measure for the equilibrium surface deposition velocities for the materials tested ( ). 4.2</text>

No model for humidity dependence of the deposition velocity of O3 to the Carrara Marble sample no. 1, is shown, as a significant deposition velocity was only measured at the relative air humidity of 90% for this sample ( ). The total modelled equilibrium surface deposition velocity over the range of humidity is given as the upper curve in the figures. The total equilibrium surface deposition velocity is the sum of the curves shown for the three separate reactions, with the dry surface, with adsorbed surface water up to one mono-layer coverage and with additional surface water. Expressions for the separate deposition processes are included in . The equilibrium surface deposition velocities on the dry surface, Kdry at RH=0%, on adsorbed water, Kads at m=1, and on additional surface water, Kwet, found from the modelling are given in . A deposition minimum was observed for all materials ( ), close to the modelled coverage of one mono-layer of adsorbed surface water (m=1). shows deposition velocities measured over the whole humidity range at both 22°C and 30°C. The figure also shows the equilibrium deposition velocities measured on a pre-dried sample at RH=0% and on bulk de-ionised water at RH=90%. In equilibrium surface deposition velocities found at RH=0% and 70% are plotted against the ratio of the real (BET) surface area to the geometric area for the six materials. 5</text>

      <text>Increased uncertainty was seen in the BET area measurements for the samples with low N2 adsorption and Areal/Ageom.&lt;∼1000. The uncertainty in the humidity-deposition velocity modelling was determined by the uncertainties in the equilibrium surface deposition velocity data, in the model approximations and in the manual modelling procedure. In it was argued that the uncertainty in the experimental measurements was probably more important than uncertainty in the manual modelling of the experimental time-dependent curves in calculating the equilibrium deposition velocities. This was based on experience with the variation in the estimated equilibrium deposition velocity for the range of possible variations in model parameters. The uncertainties in the deposition velocity data given in the were therefore calculated from the assumed experimental uncertainties of the measured parameters used in the calculation of the deposition velocities. These uncertainties were estimated to 0.5 ppb for every direct concentration measurement, 5% in the geometric area of the samples and 1% in the volumetric airflow velocity in the chamber. The uncertainty in the 48 h values was found to be in the range 0.005–0.015 cm s−1 varying between samples. The uncertainty in the blind measurements, =8×10−5 cm s−1, on the large area (≈75 dm2) of the glass chamber, was estimated to be about the same as the deposition velocity; 6×10−5 cm s−1 with 0.5 ppb deposition loss and 1.1 10−4 cm s−1 with 1.0 ppb deposition loss. Repeated measurements on stable curves representing small concentration differences did however make the uncertainty in the blind measurements smaller than this. A stable concentration decrease of 1 ppb in the blind runs was easily observed. The relative uncertainty for the equilibrium values from the modelling ( ) was set equal to the relative uncertainty calculated for the higher values measured at 48 h. The uncertainty in the RH values is low. It depends on RH of dry air being close to zero and RH for wet air being close to 100%, a condition found to be fulfilled, and on the accuracy of the flow-meters used to mix dry and wet air. The uncertainty caused by model approximations is more difficult to evaluate. However a modelling error related to the nature of the BET isotherm is apparent at RH&gt;90%, where the modelled deposition velocity increases to ∞ as there is no limit to the amount of water that could condense on the surface. Clearly, on a real surface there would be a limit. Some other possible reasons for model deviation from the experimental results are discussed below. There is additional uncertainty associated with the manual modelling approach in the humidity-deposition velocity modelling. This modelling did however only determine the position of one point, Kads at m=1, which is given by the break in the total deposition velocity curves clearly seen at RH≈50% in . Even if the manual curve fitting did not give quantitative measures for the curve fit, visual inspection of the vd-curves in should give a good picture of the possible deviation from the equilibrium surface deposition velocities. 6</text>

      <text>The dry air equilibrium surface deposition velocity, Kdry, calculated using the geometric areas of the samples, correlated positively with the real areas determined in the BET measurements, except for sample no. 4 ( and ). From visual/microscopic observation, sample no. 4 ( ) seemed to have a structure with larger pores than the other samples. It may be that the sample pieces used in the BET measurement for this material were totally permeated by N2. The measured BET-area for this material would then underestimate the real area of the larger sample exposed in the deposition experiments. This could explain the much higher vs,eq value for this sample than expected based on the relationship between vs,eq and Areal/Ageom. for the other samples ( ). Two samples, the Carrara Marble and the Spruce Whole Wood Board, had dry deposition velocities equal or close to zero. The other calcareous stones and concrete samples all had higher dry deposition velocities. Smaller real areas of the Carrara Marble sample ( ) with its dense crystalline surface and of the Spruce Whole Wood Board sample ( ), may explain their lower dry air deposition velocities. Some caution should be showed in comparison of the stone samples with the Spruce Whole Wood Board, which had a very different anisotropic structure with long cell pores from cut ends. The more porous samples possibly could retain some occluded water available for reaction with ozone in micro-pores. The run on the hard concrete floor tile sample at the higher temperature of 30°C ( ) showed a lower dry air deposition velocity, indicating removal of occluded water. The samples with a high dry air deposition velocity all showed a deposition minimum at intermediate humidity. According to the model, the measured minima are close to the air humidity giving one mono-layer of adsorbed water and therefore only one sink. At this point the equilibrium surface deposition velocity on adsorbed water, modelled as the rate constant Kads, equalled the total equilibrium surface deposition velocity. At higher humidity Kads is assumed to be constant ( ). One could hypothesise that at low, but increasing humidity the O3 molecules would increasingly have to compete for space with the more densely packed adsorbed H2O molecules. Without direct access for O3 to the dry surface uni-molecular decomposition and recombination or reaction with the adsorbed water molecules after decomposition on the dry surface, is likely to be more difficult. At the same time water adsorption would probably block and/or fill up pores in the material and so decrease the real area exposed to O3. The equilibrium surface deposition velocities measured in the range 50–90% RH showed no clear correlation with the measured real areas in dry air ( for RH=70%). This lack of correlation can probably be explained by the proposed change in the reaction pathways and corresponding rate of the O3 reaction on the materials at increased air humidity and by a change in total really exposed areas with increased water adsorption. O3 may be consumed as it diffuses into the material and even in dry air the really exposed area may be somewhat smaller than that measured in the BET experiments. In a decrease in the diffusion coefficient was observed for the best fitting model in the range from RH=0% to 50%, reaching an approximately constant value in the range from 50% to 90%. If the really exposed areas can be linearly correlated with the value of the diffusion coefficient this would mean a 3.7 times (calculation from data in ) smaller exposed area and correspondingly larger vs,eq., Kads and Kwet at RH=50–90% than at RH=0% for sample no. 5, and . One would suppose that corrections in the same direction could be made to the parameter values for the other materials ( ). More research is however needed to describe the effect of water adsorption on Areal/Ageom. The assumption of a fixed reaction rate constant at high humidity, Kwet, that does not depend on the air humidity and the number of mono-layers of water on the surface, is probably inaccurate. The deposition velocity of O3 on pure de-ionised water was measured to 0.0035 cm s−1 ( and ). This is more than an order of magnitude less than that measured at RH=90% on most of the samples ( and ). From this it seems that the increasing deposition velocity on the samples at increasing air humidity cannot be explained by more bulk water on the surface. Rather the adsorbed state of the additional added mono-layers of water or the activity of OH− in the water, or possibly other species dissolved in the water, probably explains the measured increase in the deposition velocity. One could hypothesise that the deposition velocity on adsorbed water would decrease as more water with close to bulk properties adds on to the surface at high air humidity. Similarly the activity of OH− ions or other possibly catalytic species in the surface water may decrease due to dilution, as more water add on at higher humidity. This would mean that Kwet should probably decrease with increasing mass of water on the surface, and that the model curves at high humidity ( ), should be less convex. A model deviation in this direction is seen for the Maltese Limestone sample no. 3 ( ). The approximation of a constant Kwet does, however, in general give a quite good fit for the samples. This indicates that the total reaction rate is determined by a species with an amount largely proportional to the thickness of the surface water layer, m, in . The softer concrete floor tile sample no. 6 ( ), showed a deviating high deposition velocity after 48 h at RH=50%, whereas the modelled equilibrium value was very low. This aggregate concrete sample was the least uniform of the samples and different properties affecting diffusion into the sample pieces, like cracking, surface area of pebbles, etc., could explain the irregularity. The variation in the Kwet values ( ) is within a narrow range for the stone materials. A somewhat higher Kwet was measured on the wood sample. Variation in Kwet among the materials can probably be explained by variations in the bonding strength of water to the surfaces, ΔdesHH2O ( ), and/or the activity of OH− ions and other species dissolved in the adsorbed water at high air humidity. In it can be seen that the deposition velocity of O3 on the hard concrete floor tile decreased at low air humidity and increased at high air humidity, when the temperature was increased from 22°C to 30°C. The increase at high humidity may be explained with a typical Arrhenius increase in the surface reaction rate constant for an activated reaction when the temperature is increased. The decrease at low air humidity needs a different explanation. Less water should be present in pores in the material in dry air and at low humidity at the higher temperature. This could give a lower deposition velocity. Or O3 possibly decomposes directly to O2 on the surface in dry air without reacting with H2O, and the thermodynamics of this reaction gave the negative temperature dependence. This however needs further investigation. 7</text>

      <text>This work has shown that humidity modelling, using the BET isotherm to describe surface water adsorption, makes prediction of the O3 equilibrium surface deposition velocities to materials possible over a humidity range from RH=0% to ≈90%. The value of the O3 equilibrium surface deposition velocity could be modelled as a combination of two pathways, deposition on the dry surface and on directly adsorbed water at low RH, and on directly adsorbed water and on additional surface water at high RH. The weight and possibly the rate of each pathway would depend on the strength of the bonding between water and surface, which would determine the surface water coverage. The deposition minimum observed at intermediate humidity fitted well with the position of one mono-layer of adsorbed water on the surfaces determined from the BET isotherm. An order of magnitude lower deposition velocity was measured on bulk de-ionised water than on the sample materials at RH=90%, indicating that the O3 surface reaction at high air humidity did not happen with bulk water as such. Rather it probably depended on the adsorbed nature of the water and/or OH− ions or other dissolved species in the surface water. When the air temperature was raised from 22°C to 30°C measured deposition velocities of O3 on a hard concrete floor tile decreased at low air humidity and increased at high air humidity. High deposition velocities may be wanted to reduce indoor concentrations of O3. It is well known that increased porosity of material surfaces and increased air humidity may increase the deposition velocity. However, for spruce wood, calcareous stone and concrete materials a monotonous positive effect of increased real (BET) area over all the materials, excepting the special case of sample no. 4 (see ), is only seen at relative air humidity below ≈30% in this study. A positive correlation between air humidity and deposition velocity has been generally assumed. This study however shows that for porous calcareous stone and concrete materials this is not the case over the whole humidity range. Increased deposition velocities with decreasing RH were observed at lower humidity. This means that such materials should be well suited as indoor building materials in dry environments when reduction of concentrations of O3 and possibly of other gaseous contaminants is a concern. Samples showing a high dry air deposition velocity all showed a deposition velocity minimum at some intermediate humidity. The RH in indoor air is most often kept at intermediate recommended values of ≈40–60%, where the deposition velocities measured on the porous calcareous stone and concrete materials were the lowest. This implies that little indoor ozone reduction would usually be expected from deposition to these materials at equilibrium. In real situations, when ozone concentrations fluctuate, the equilibrium situation may however not be reached resulting in higher mean deposition velocities.</text>
